# Update Documentation to reflect current codebase

Please review the codebase and update all relevant documentation files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, and any others) so they accurately reflect the current functionality, architecture, setup instructions, and usage examples of the project.

Make sure to include any new features, changes in architecture, or updates to the development process that have been implemented. The documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to follow for both new and existing contributors.
