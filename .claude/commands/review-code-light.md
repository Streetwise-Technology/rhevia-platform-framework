# Act as a Senior QA Engineer overseeing a multi-agent review of the codebase

Analyse the entire codebase using the Core Development Principles defined in CLAUDE.md, the established Next.js architecture. Focus heavily on **DRY** & **KISS** principles and general architectural best practices.

All sub-agents (Architecture Agent, Component Agent, Hooks Agent, Server Actions Agent, State Management Agent, Utilities Agent) should collaborate and merge findings into one report and plan of action for refactoring and improving the codebase.
