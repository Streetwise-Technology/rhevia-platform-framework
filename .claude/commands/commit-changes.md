# Analyse my working directory and help me commit changes

1. Review all modified, added, and deleted files.

2. Group related changes logically (e.g., by feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, style).

3. Stage the grouped changes.

4. Generate clear, descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard (e.g., feat: add new model for radar data, fix: correct schema validation bug). And don't reference claude in the commit messages.

5. Commit the staged changes in multiple commits if needed, ensuring each commit is atomic and focused.

Confirm that all changes have been committed.
